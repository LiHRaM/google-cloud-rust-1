# How to contribute

We definitely welcome feedback and contribution to Google product APIs! 
Here is some guideline and information about how to do so.

## Technical requirements

You will need several tools to work with this repository. At minimum,
you need both [Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/google/protobuf)
and [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc) in order to compile this
repository and generate client library source code in Rust.

To compile the generated code into usable client libraries, you will
need to use appropriate development environments and setup proper
build configurations.

## Additional notes

Currently, this does not generate ready-to-use client libraries yet.
